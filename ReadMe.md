# What
This is a basic webpack setup that leverages BrowserSync and will output your JS and SCSS. Good for basic projects where you need something other than Gulp and Grunt, and you want to use the features webpack offers.

# Get Started
- install dependencies: `npm install`
- compile: `webpack`
- watch: `webpack --watch`
